Description: Flatten and restore directory structures into a single text file
 repo-pack is a command-line tool that flattens a directory (like a Git
 repository) into a single, portable text file. It preserves directory
 structure and text file contents, including SHA-256 checksums for
 integrity verification.
 .
 It automatically detects and skips binary files using libmagic and can
 be used for feeding codebases to LLMs, creating simple text-based
 backups, or distributing related text files together.
 .
 The tool supports packing a directory to standard output and unpacking
 an archive file (or standard input) to a specified directory, with
 optional SHA-256 verification during unpack.
